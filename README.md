# ORAN-Radio-Interface Project

## IP Documentation
This can be found on the [**oran_radio_if lounge**](https://www.xilinx.com/member/oran-radio-if.html). Registration is required for this site.

## Project Information

This project contains the C LibMetal driver for the oran_radio_if IP. Additionally a C application is supplied demonstrating how to use the library to configure the IP. Full build instructions and scripts are provided for Vivado and Petalinux.

## GitHub Usage
The master branch of the GitHub repository contains the latest version for the current Xilinx release.

Releases are aligned with the Xilinx tools release schedule, at which point the archive is tagged e.g., v2021.2, and a "Release" is created on GitHub. All post-release fixes/changes are made on the master/HEAD.

Therefore, the "latest" usable code for the current Xilinx release is normally master/HEAD.

Code for previous Xilinx releases can of course be checked-out via commit hash, or by tag.
