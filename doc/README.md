## Doc Directory

This directory is for documentation, including auto-generated documentation (e.g. by Doxygen).

### Doxygen instructions

Documentation for the embedded software documentation can be generated automatically using Doxygen.

Use the command `doxygen config.dox`

Doxygen generates the documentation in the `html/` directory, and the main file is `html/index.html` which can be opened with a web browser.

You can view the generated documentation [here](./html/index.html)

For more information on Doxygen refer to:
